When life gives you lemons, DON'T make lemonade!
Make life take the lemons back!
GET MAD!
Do you know who I am?!
I don't want your damn lemons, what the hell am I supposed to do with these?!
Demand to see life's manager!
Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons!
Do you know who I am?!
I'm the man who's going to burn your house down!
With the lemons!
I'll get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns your house down!
